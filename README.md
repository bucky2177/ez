# ez - Revival fork

The aim of the `ez` package for R is to provide a simplified/unified interface to common analysis techniques, including analysis of variance and mixed effects modeling. 

This revival site has been forked from the original `ez` repository (https://github.com/mike-lawrence/ez), with the intend of bringing `ez` back on CRAN. 

The original author Mike Lawrence (https://github.com/mike-lawrence) is not responding to mails, pull requests, or issues, and the last updates on `ez` are 10 years ago. Thus, I decided to step in as a maintainer, knowing that `ez` has been a valuable software for science. In case Mike will start again developing `ez`, this fork will be deleted or properly merged.
